                From wasted food to plastic packaging, the kitchen is the biggest source of rubbish in our home. 
                Check out some simple ways to reduce the amount of waste generated at the heart of every household.</p>

                        of the material, which means that they are not transformed into new containers, but into cheap plastic 
                        bags that eventually end up in a landfill. If possible, use glass or metal packaging as they 
                        can be recycled without any loss in quality.<br>Try to give things a new life! Jam jars are

                        No worries! Most products are valid for up to 4 days after their expiry date. If the smell and texture
